# Airbnb Recommendations & Natural Language Processing (NLP) Analysis

Airbnb is an online marketplace that is focussed on connecting people who rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations around the world. If you're like me and love to travel, Airbnb provides a cheaper alternative to hotels while also offering an eccentric experience that adds value to vacations.

I personally love traveling to the west coast and finding unique Airbnb listings. Sometimes I'd find myself wanting to go back but have trouble looking for a similar experience. There is currently no system in place where Airbnb will provide (or recommend) similar homes I have previously stayed in. 

So that got me thinking; **Can I develop a machine learning recommendation system that can provide recommendations for similar listings that I have stayed in? Additionally, what can we learn from text descriptions for Airbnb listings?**

For this analysis, the following machine learning concepts were practiced:

### Recommendation System:
A recommendation system helps users find compelling content in a large mass of data. For example, a machine learning recommendation model determines how similar listings are to other listings then provides recommendations based on similarity. A recommendation engine can display items that users might not have been to search for on their own. This is the basis of most recommendation systems and the inspiration for this project. 

### Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
NLP makes it possible for computers to understand the human language. NLP analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences and uses algorithms to find and extract the individual meaning of words. We are most accustomed to NLP schemes with virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri, that translate spoken text into meaning that the machines can understand. For this project, we will be performing some NLP analysis on Airbnb listing descriptions and incoorporating a sentiment analysis in the recommendation engine.
